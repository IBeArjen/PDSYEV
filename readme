All Fortran source files can be found in /home/dc-yurc1/scratch/diag/PDSYEV, see also makefile. 
The job size should be specified in the input file, 
see, for examplle, ./inp/gen_n_20.inp,gen_n_100.inp,gen_n_10.inp 

We use a two-steps submission script:
./b_diag.sh gen_n_10.inp  24 36 
which calls the running script sub_script.csh. Here 24 is the number of nodes and 36 is the wall time. 
In the input (ASCII) file please ignore all lines except 
GEN-MAT 10
where 10 is the matrix dimension (the order of line is not important as well as the number of spaces). 
The input is not case-sensitive, parentheses are used for comments.
